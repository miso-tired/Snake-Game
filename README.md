# Snake-Game
A basic snake game. Try to collect the nodes to make the snake big as possible and try to survive as long as you can!
In order to make a grid in the CSS file I used CodingNepal to help code:
CodingNepal (2023). How to Create A Snake Game in HTML CSS & JavaScript (v1) [.wrapper {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    width: 70vmin;
    height: 70vmin;
    background: #ccc;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
.grid {
    background: #b7b1e6;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    display: grid;
    grid-template: repeat(25, 1fr) / repeat(25, 1fr);
